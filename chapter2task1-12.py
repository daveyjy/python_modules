#Scenario
# As you surely know, due to some astronomical reasons, years may be leap or common. The former are 366 days long, while the latter are 365 days long.

# Since the introduction of the Gregorian calendar (in 1582), the following rule is used to determine the kind of year:

# if the year number isn't divisible by four, it's a common year;
# otherwise, if the year number isn't divisible by 100, it's a leap year;
# otherwise, if the year number isn't divisible by 400, it's a common year;
# otherwise, it's a leap year.
# Look at the code in the editor â€“ it only reads a year number, and needs to be completed with the instructions implementing the test we've just described.

# The code should output one of two possible messages, which are Leap year or Common year, depending on the value entered.

# It would be good to verify if the entered year falls into the Gregorian era, 
# and output a warning otherwise: Not within the Gregorian calendar period. Tip: use the != and % operators.


year = int(input("Enter a year: "))

#if year is less than 1582, it is not in the gregorian calendar
if year < 1582:
	print("Not within the Gregorian calendar period")
 
else:
# otherwise working out if year is not divisible by 4, and therefore a COMMON YEAR
    if year % 4 != 0:         
        print("Common year") 

#otherwise working out if year is not divisible by 100, it is a leap year
    elif year % 100 != 0:
        print("leap year")

#otherwise working out if the year is not divisible by 400, it is a common year  
    elif year % 400 != 0:
        print("Common year")
#if non of the above arguments have been satisfied, it's a leap year
    else:
        print ("leap year")
