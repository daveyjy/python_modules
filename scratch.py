#using lists within lists, create a means of storage for a TTT tic tac toe game, noughts and crosses
#the TTT board is 3 rows and 3 columns
#Before continuing, read the below code which shows how to create a chess board
#https://github.com/chrishoran8/PythonEssentialsModule3/blob/master/PythonEssentialsModule3/rowsSection.py
#As you can see, there are multiple ways to do this. The only requirement is that you get it working
#However, if you want to challenge yourself, get it working in as little lines of code as possible

tttBoard = []

#put code here to create your board using lists within lists. Populate each of the 9 spaces on 
#the board with a "_"


#Minimum exercise

#output the list to the screen

#put some code in which changes one of the 9 spaces to a "o"
    


#Extension Exercise

#If you are feeling like a ninja, 
#Create a suitable loop which will be known as the "Game Loop"
#At the start of each iteration, the board will be printed to the screen
#Then, take the following inputs from the user during each iteration: column, row, o or x
#This should allow a simple verion of the game
