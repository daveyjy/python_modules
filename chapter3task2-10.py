# Scenario
# The continue statement is used to skip the current block and move ahead to the next iteration, without executing the statements inside the loop.

# It can be used with both the while and for loops.

# Your task here is very special: you must design a vowel eater! Write a program that uses:

# a for loop;
# the concept of conditional execution (if-elif-else)
# the continue statement.
# Your program must:

# ask the user to enter a word;
# use user_word = user_word.upper() to convert the word entered by the user to upper case; we'll talk about string methods and the upper() method very soon â€“ don't worry;
# use conditional execution and the continue statement to "eat" the following vowels A, E, I, O, U from the inputted word;
# print the uneaten letters to the screen, each one of them on a separate line.
# Test your program with the data we've provided for you.

user_word = input("Tell me your word full of vowels?")
user_word = user_word.upper ()


for letter in user_word:
    if letter in ("A","E","I","O","U"):
        continue
    else:
        print(letter,"\n")
